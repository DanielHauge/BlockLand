1: Introduction
-------------------

### A. Purpose of the system
____________
The system is made to allow users to share and discuss stories with a focus on programming and information systems, the system allows self regulation by allowing users to increase the visibility of some discussions, and for long time users to decrease the visibilty of others.

### B. Scope of the system
____________
The system needs to allow multiple users to interact with the server through a web browser and make their account which enables them to post stories and comments, and also enable them to give or take karma and report stories.
The system will also include an API that can be used as an interface to interacting with the system.

### C. Objectives and success criteria of the project
____________
The project must be able to handle multiple users posting stories and comments at the same time, while also having a minimum 95% uptime even while part of the system is down for upgrading. The project needs to allows users to make a program that can simulate user interaction that creates stories and comments using a REST API, also to query the latest ingested story. likewise the users should also be able to do these actions using a web browser as well.

### D. Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations
____________
The term stories are used when we talk about the concept of posting news stories to the system. When we go into more technical details of the functionality of the system we use the term threads, but stories and threads are essentially the same thing.

we will use HN User for Hacker news user.

When we mention the system, we mean the broad concept of the whole system, which will include server and database and any other component that will effect the application.

### E. References
____________
- Hacker News: https://news.ycombinator.com/newest.
- Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/

### F. Overview
____________
The product will be a student project focused on making a copy of Hacker News from the ground up, while keeping it maintained over the duration of this semester. Around halfway through we will hand over testing to another group, who will send feedback on errors that we will have to repair while they are testing. In this period we'll test another groups project at the same time, and send them feedback on errors we encounter. This is to showcase our proficiency in building and maintaining a web based system as well as testing a foreign system and giving feedback that's useful to the owners of the system.



----------


2: Current system
-------------------
The system Hacker News is an online web forum news site, which shares many similarities with the popular site Reddit. it allows users of the website to register themselves with an account and share stories and comment on other users stories. additionaly users can give or take karma from stories and comments that increase or decreases their priority on the site. This allows the users to show what content that contributes to the discussion they have interest in. In the case of Hacker News it's any discussion on hacking, programming or news regarding these activities in general, while taking away focus from disruptive or unwanted discussion.


----------


3: Proposed system
-------------------
### A. Overview
____________
The proposed system would be a both a REST API server, that handles the multiple users, and a Database that contains all the content of the system, which the user generated.

### C. Nonfunctional requirements
____________
#### a. Usability
- We will not put too much effort into the usability of the system since the main purpose, is that the system should be used via the API / Simulation program. Therefore the use of the web application will not be required to be exactly the same as hacker news.
#### b. Reliability
- The web application needs to have 95% uptime.
- The system cannot lose any information which has been sent from the simulation program or web users.

#### d. Supportability
- (extra)The system needs to work on popular browsers such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer 9.
- The system needs to have a mechanism so that when users post content and the system is down, the content will be published to the system when it's operational again.
#### e. Implementation
- The system needs to have a REST API for the simulation program to simulate user activity.
#### f. Interface
- The system needs to interact with a database for storage of user information and content.
- The system needs to interact with a REST API for the simulation program and other users.
#### g. Packing

# BlockLand
Blockchain project


##### Task
- Simulator = Pretty good state
- Peer to peer program = pretty good state
- RAD document = pretty good state, could use business version
- Sequence diagram
- CI/CD
- One line set up.
- Extra: Mobile app

## Notes
- showcase difference in our system from bitcoins: Council vs anarchy. Bitcoins: fastest gets rewarded, not needed for us.
- Mining speed will not matter for our council style = Structured fairness.
- When does it stop working, how many blocks can be sent over TCP
- UML diagram: Sequence + component diagram.
- Flaw: If something occurs at the exact same time, the business logic becomes very heavy, they will need to agree upon who came first and stuff.

## Wishfull thinking
- Docker swarm
- Grafana/prometheus
